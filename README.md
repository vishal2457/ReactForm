## ReactForm
- A small snippet written to build form with lots of input 
- Still in development
- Experimental

## Rules
- Specify key at first of every object,
- validations need to be in a array of objects,
- col supports md, xs, lg etc to passed in object

## Example form available in ExampleForm.js

# Not Supported 
* Radio buttons are not supported YET,
- Use single input to work around radio buttons
- If radio buttons are in between form you can split form in two parts

* No way to check if form is in valid state or invalid state
- Contributions are appreciated.
